    <br>
    
    In 1981, Doris joined Cordia on the frontline caring for our people with her compassion and kindness. Her caring nature and drive to succeed saw her rise to the top within a few years as she became area manager and then regional coordinator. She hung up her Cordia coat ðŸ§¥ and grey and gold tunic for good in 1987 and put on her famous blue pinstripe suit for the first time as she became CEO of Cordia Yugoslavia. 
    <br>
    In her role in the Yugoslavia she promoted Cordia services to people who needed them most. Her time on the ground is always on her mind and she has never forgotten her roots. For Doris, her team and those she cares for must always come first. To this day she continues to work with Cordia colleagues in homes, schools and in the multitudes of places Cordia operates. 
    <br>
    This dedication and service, all handled with grace and style, was recognised in 1989 when Doris was awarded the Cordia Cooksies Cross at the annual BKAs (Barbara Kerr Awards). In that same year, the Director of Cordia announced that Doris would be presiding over talks to reunify Cordia West Germany and the Eastern Cordia Service. This challenging position was bestowed upon Doris because of her reputation for her powerful presence and excellent mediation skills. After the reunification in 1990, Doris returned to her role in Yugoslavia until its dissolution in 1992. In 1993 Cordia Yugoslavia was divided and Doris was given the title of Director of Former Yugoslav Republic Cordias. 
    <br>
    In 2000 at the Cordia Millenium Awards, held in the Allianz Arena and hosted by Special Envoy Nana Mouskouri, Doris was presented with the Rose of Cordia. The Rose is the highest award in Cordia and has only ever been awarded once. At the ceremony Special Envoy Nana also announced that Doris was to take up the role of Director of Cordia Europe in 2001. This newly created role gave Doris the tools and the power to build Cordia into the European household name it is today and to bring our services to even more people. 
    <br>
    This brings us to today and Doris has just launched the Cordia Fairfax Advice Bureau and opened a new Cordia Europe HQ in Lucerne where she will hand over the keys to incoming Director of Europe, CÃ©line Dion. 
    <br>
    At the 2016 Cordia Awards, current chairwoman and founder announced that she would be retiring from active service but would remain on the board and take up an advisory role day to day. Madame Pradera asked Doris at the event if she would take over as Cheif Executive of the Cordia Group and of course Doris accepted. 
    <br> 
    For her many years service to Cordia and the people we care for, we wish to thank Doris for her continued and unrelenting efforts and the compassion she has always shown in her role.
